```{r setup, include=FALSE}
source("../source/analysis.R")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Covid Report
Based on the analysis.R file, the total number of US cases is `r get_total_cases()`. And, the total number of US deaths is `r get_total_deaths()`. 

(**Note**: Why are there no commas in the *total number of US deaths* ? Can you change `analysis.R` file so that the number is commented with commas?)

I also want to show the chart:
``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
